# Composition files

Composition files are YAML documents with layer configurations. They are used for generating new projects and recording how a current project was generated. The composition files used for generating new projects are usually minimal, compared to the `.composition.yaml` file `cookie-composer` writes in the project as a record of state.

For example, a basic composition file for generating new projects might look like:

```{literalinclude} /_includes/example-composition.yaml
---
language: yaml
linenos:
name: example-composition-yaml
caption: package-composition.yaml
---
```

When this is used to create a project:

```{literalinclude} /_includes/interactive-create.txt
---
language: console
name: interactive-create
---
```

The composition file saved in the new project (named `my-test-project` in this example) as `.composition.yaml` would look like:

```{literalinclude} /_includes/rendered-composition.yaml
---
language: yaml
name: rendered-composition-yaml
linenos:
caption: .composition.yaml
---
```

If you look closely you'll see that `.composition.yaml` contains the contents of `package-composition.yaml`. Internally the `.composition.yaml` file is termed a "rendered composition" because it contains all the parameters used to render this specific project. This rendered composition is used when applying updates of the templates. 

## Template layers

Composition files are technically [YAML streams](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#22-structures) consisting of one or more documents describing a layer configuration.
